      content:
        "Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. It provides a framework for modeling systems in which there is a rate of change between values that vary in relation to each other. The two main branches are differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus concerns instantaneous rates of change and the slopes of curves. Integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities and the areas under and between curves.",

        "Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that form the foundation for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces. The three laws are: 1) An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a force. 2) The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied. 3) For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",
